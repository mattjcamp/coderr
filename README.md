# Code R

**coderr** started as a method to automate writing SQL code for use cases that involved applications that would be data driven. You can still see this original package by looking at the branch `snapshot_2025_12_12` on GitHub.

More recently, I have adjusted coderr to be a repository for shortcuts that I use in general coding. This continues to be mainly for SQL but coderr has been simplied to make it more useable for quickly writing queries.
